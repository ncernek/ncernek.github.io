While investigating better ways to maintain documentation I came across these articles, [Designing the Documentation for a Developer Product](http://blog.codeship.io/2014/09/11/designing-documentation-for-developer-products.html) by [Codeship](http://codeship.io), and [Creating Sustainable Documentation with Jekyll](https://sendgrid.com/blog/creating-sustainable-documentation-with-jekyll/) by [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com). Although it looks like we will be implementing a different solution for documentation at work, the ease of this setup intruged me and I thought, "I could use this for my blog!", and a few hours later I had my site up.

I couldn't believe I had gone this long without thinking to host my blog with Github pages and Jekyll. I have tried Wordpress and Ghost blogs and both got the job done, but the one thing that was always annoying about both was the hosting.

I don't need a ton of power for my blog, I don't have a ton of followers but I also don't want slow page loads. (A bigger issue with Wordpress) This forced me to sign up for hosting plans that cost anywhere from between $20 to $50 a month. Not to mention the issues I had with [Digitial Ocean](http://digitalocean.com) losing my data.

With Jekyll and Github pages I don't have to worry about any of that. Version control is my storage, and I just push to update my site, Jekyll handles the dynamic nature I am used to and spits out a static site that Github can serve. It took about an hour for the initial set up and another three hours for the initial theming.

As of right now my theme is very bare bones but I don't need much else and for now this should do just fine. I recommend giving it a shot if you haven't already.
